Hi! My name is Stephen Solis-Reyes. I'm a Master's student in [Computer Science](https://www.csd.uwo.ca) at [The University of Western Ontario](https://www.uwo.ca).

You can check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephensolisreyes), [GitHub](https://github.com/stephensolis), or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/StephenSolisReyes) pages, if you'd like.

Want to contact me? Just [send me an email](mailto:stephsolis@gmail.com).

### My research

I'm currently working with [Dr. Lila Kari](http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~lila) in [her lab](http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~lila/biocomplab.html), on a very cool and powerful method for supervised classification of DNA sequences. Here's the [pipeline](https://github.com/stephensolis/modmap-pipeline), [curated datasets](https://github.com/stephensolis/modmap-experiments), and [highly efficient underlying generation code](https://github.com/stephensolis/modmap-generator-cpp) I've developed for the project.

I'm also co-author [of a paper](http://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-016-1157-8) on related work with a neat quantitative method of visualizing genome relatedness we call Molecular Distance Maps ([try it online](http://rallis.github.io/MoDMaps3D), and see [some code](https://github.com/stephensolis/modmap-generator) I developed for it) -- that work was together with [Rallis Karamichalis](https://www.csd.uwo.ca/~rkaramic).
