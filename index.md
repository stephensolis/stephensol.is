Hi! My name is Stephen Solis-Reyes. I'm a member of the engineering and operations leadership team at [Triage](https://www.triage.com), a revolutionary healthcare-focused AI startup.

You can check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephensolisreyes), [GitHub](https://github.com/stephensolis), or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/StephenSolisReyes) pages, if you'd like.

Want to contact me? Just [send me an email](mailto:stephsolis@gmail.com) (or a [text message](sms:1-226-448-1436)).

### My research

I was a Master's student in [Computer Science](https://www.csd.uwo.ca) at [The University of Western Ontario](https://www.uwo.ca). I worked with [Dr. Lila Kari](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~lila/) in [her lab](https://www.csd.uwo.ca/~lila/biocomplab.html), on a general and powerful method for supervised classification of DNA sequences. Here's [my thesis](https://ir.lib.uwo.ca/etd/5792), as well as the [user-friendly classification tool](https://github.com/stephensolis/kameris), [curated datasets](https://github.com/stephensolis/kameris-experiments), and [efficient underlying generation code](https://github.com/stephensolis/kameris-backend) I developed for the project. I'm also co-author of [a paper](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0206409) which came out of this project.

I'm also co-author of [another paper](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-016-1157-8) on related work with a neat quantitative method of visualizing genome relatedness we call Molecular Distance Maps ([try it online](http://rallis.github.io/MoDMaps3D), and see [some code](https://github.com/stephensolis/modmap-generator) I developed for it) -- that work was together with [Rallis Karamichalis](https://www.csd.uwo.ca/~rkaramic).
